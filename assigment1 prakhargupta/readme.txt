Code files of sql are for Q1 to Q4
They must be ran in the order as the name depicts code1 ---> code4
analysis.sql contains some queries for the analysis done to study the data


Python file q5.py is for Q5 where we try to inser new records in the database.
Python uses psycopg2(2.9.3) library as a driver for connecting with the postgre database.

Which can be installed using pip in the terminal-
"pip install psycop2"

I have attached a requirement.txt file which contains all the packages and their versions which are
installed in the development environment in case there is a version issue.

"pip install -r requirements.txt " can be used for matching exact versions of packages.
